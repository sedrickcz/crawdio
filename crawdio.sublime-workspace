This is the access to Alpha version of the game and it will be available to all tiers from the Baron onwards.</p>\\r\\n<p>When the game is in Beta stage, we will release the full game beta as Early Access on PC (or any other platform where it’s going to be possible) for all backers up from the Knight Tier.</p>\\r\\n<p>Our backers can influence the development, help us improve the game, and give us feedback about our game mechanics.</p>	0	2014-03-03 02:22:12.995422	2014-03-28 12:43:11.742324\n  927  \\.\n\n/Users/jirikratochvil/Workspace/Projects/crawdio/app/assets/stylesheets/users.css.scss:\n 3514  \n 3515  \n 3516: #post-shop {display: block;\n 3517  background: rgba(124, 99, 0, 0.55);\n 3518  position: relative;}\n\n/Users/jirikratochvil/Workspace/Projects/crawdio/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb:\n   16    <div id=\"primary\" class=\"content-area\">\n   17        <div id=\"content\" class=\"site-content\" role=\"main\">\n   18:         <article id=\"post-shop\" > \n   19            <div class=\"decorator\"></div>\n   20            <div class=\"navbar-top-hr\">\n\n/Users/jirikratochvil/Workspace/Projects/crawdio/app/views/refinery/_header.html.erb:\n   48  								<li id=\"menu-item-268\" class=\"menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-268\"><a href=\"http://kingdomcomerpg.com/?page_id=266\">Game</a></li>\n   49  								<li id=\"menu-item-243\" class=\"menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-243\"><a href=\"http://kingdomcomerpg.com/?page_id=239\">Media</a></li>\n   50: 								<li id=\"menu-item-shop\" class=\"menu-item menu-item-type-custom menu-item-object-custom menu-item-274\"><a href=\"/\">Shop</a></li>\n   51  								<li id=\"menu-item-274\" class=\"menu-item menu-item-type-custom menu-item-object-custom menu-item-274\"><a href=\"http://forum.kingdomcomerpg.com/\">Forum</a></li>\n   52  								<li id=\"menu-item-83\" class=\"menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-83\"><a href=\"http://kingdomcomerpg.com/?page_id=81\">About us</a></li>\n\n/Users/jirikratochvil/Workspace/Projects/crawdio/config/initializers/refinery/core.rb:\n   21  \n   22    # Site name\n   23:   config.site_name = \"Kingdom Come: Deliverance Shop\"\n   24  \n   25    # This activates Google Analytics tracking within your website.

What is Act I, II and III? Why there is not cheaper tier offering all three Acts?</strong> </p>\\r\\n<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Act I, as it is planned, is a full scale, stand-alone game. It has 30+ hours of gameplay, complete open world map, all quests and closed story line. Most (if not all) game mechanics described above will be included: horse riding, combat, castle sieges, there will be at least one large-scale battle. Acts II &amp; III extend the story, add new environment in separate maps, new quests, gear and weapons. They will also add new quests to the map of Act I. It will be possible to travel between maps of all Acts, some quests will require you to visit all of them.</p>\\r\\n<p>We definitely intend to make Acts II &amp; III and release them as soon as possible. However, our funding and schedule does not reach past first Act. We will finalize our plans for the release of Acts II &amp; III when we get closer to the release date of Act I. For these reasons we don’t want to offer and promise them as a Kickstarter reward in their own right. We want to use them as a token of our gratitude to higher tiers backers, but you should think about it more like 100% discount offer than a guaranteed reward.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em> </p>\\r\\n<p><strong>What platforms are offered to backers on Kickstarter and what is minimum requirement of PC version ?</strong> </p>\\r\\n<p>We are developing the game to run smoothly on “good gaming PC” and next-gen consoles. If you have a PC, hardware-wise similar to Xbox One or PS4, you should be able to run Kingdom Come: Deliverance well.</p>\\r\\n<p>About platforms: we are using proven technology (Cryengine by CryTek) that runs on both PS4 and Xbox One, as well as on Windows PC, Mac and Linux. While we are developing on PC , we definitely want to bring the game to other platforms. While there should be nothing but technical problems with Linux and Mac, on closed platforms we need to deal with the platform holders and we cannot prejudge their decision. In an ideal world, we would release the game on all five platforms at the same time.</p>\\r\\n<p>In our world, we can offer you PC version in all tiers. From the “Baron” tier above, you will be able to choose our game on any platform you wish from those mentioned above (i.e. Windows PC / Mac / Linux / Xbox One / PS4), with the proviso that on consoles the game must be approved by the platform holders first. In case we are not able to finish or release the game on the platform you chose for any reason, you will be able to choose again (from available platforms) or demand your money back.</p>\\r\\n<p>UDPATE: Since we came to agreement with Microsoft we can now guarantee Xbox One version of the game also on lower tiers. The situation is still the same with PS4 though. Actual situation:</p>\\r\\n<p>Soldier, Knight: 1 license, digital copy (Win/Mac/Linux/Xone) OR physical copy (Win/Mac/Linux) <br />Baron, Viscount, Earl: 1 license, digital copy AND physical copy (Win/Mac/Linux/Xone/PS4) <br />Duke and all higher tiers: 2 licenses, 2 digital copies AND 1 physical copy (Win/Mac/Linux/Xone/PS4)</p>\\r\\n<p>UPDATE 2: We have now been approved by Sony for PS4 as well. We are now happy to offer the digital version for all platforms and for all tiers. With boxed version on console platforms, we are not sure, but the worst-case scenario is that you will get all physical rewards (including box, etc.) for your tier and a digital license.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Feb 19 2014 12:12 PM CET</em> </p>\\r\\n<p><strong>But how can I choose a specific platform while pledging? </strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>You don’t need to! Just choose a pledge that suits you. Your pledge will be filed and if it’s of Baron tier or higher you will be asked to choose a platform once the release date draws nigh. You can change this any time later – we will inform you how to do that via an e-mail.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>What are the differences between PC and console versions of the game? </strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>We develop both version together so neither is a port of the other. Technically speaking, console version will be very similar to a PC one; it’s probable that on a high-end PC you can get better and smoother visual effects but artistic feeling should be very close.</p>\\r\\n<p>Controls-wise, the game is designed separately for console controller and for keyboard &amp; mouse gaming. Of course, you can still use your favorite game controller on PC or on SteamBox. But if you decide to use mouse and keyboard, you will control the game just like other first-person games on the market: you will be able to use your mouse in the UI, there will be no controller hints and controls will be fully customizable. Some control elements may be slightly different on keyboard &amp; mouse than they are on a gamepad but neither control method will be generally superior to the other.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Can I download the game even if I buy the physical reward tier? </strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>On Soldier and Knight you have to choose between digital and physical copy of the game. We anticipate that there will be some costs associated with digital distribution (and we know there are going to be costs with the physical copies) and for this reason we have created an option to choose one or the other and we cannot fulfill both. From Baron (special edition) tier upwards you will get both physical and digital version of the game.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Do you plan to support Oculus Rift? </strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>Cryengine supports Oculus Rift by default, so general answer is: yes. We plan to support this awesome hardware gadget.<br />Oculus Rift captured the imagination of many players and you ask about it very often. Cryengine supports Oculus Rift by default, however we realize that the game has to be developed with Oculus in mind and we are aware of their recommended Best Practices. We shall try to stick to these recommendations, but VR is still an uncharted territory and we can’t guarantee ideal results from get go. To create horse riding experience that won’t give you motion sickness looks like a real challenge.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>What language versions do you plan? </strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>We’re creating the game in English and with English voiceovers. We would like to make French, Italian, German and Spanish versions of the game as well. Our past experience also suggests there will be a Polish, Russian and Czech version of the game, not necessarily with voiceovers, though.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>What type of sword do I get on the highest tiers? </strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>It is a medieval European 15th century type of one-handed sword (for Emperor, Wenzel der Faule and Pope tiers) or hand-and-a-half sword, also called bastard sword (Illuminatus and Saint tiers). It is a real-sized hand-forged weapon created by a local blacksmith, not a serial production. It can be used for combat or combat training, you can choose whether it's sharpened or not. We will communicate with you via e-mail once the campaign ends regarding the details.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>If I get physical as well as digital copy of the game, how many licenses do I get? </strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>This depends on your Tier (and we apologize it is not clearer in the tier description):<br />On Baron and Earl tier you only receive one license (i.e. you can play either one, but you cannot for example sell the box and keep the digital copy). Obviously, both physical and digital license have to be on the same platform.</p>\\r\\n<p>From Duke tier upwards you receive additional digital copy, meaning extra digital license. The physical and 'first' digital copy again have to be for the same platform, but the extra license can be for a different one.</p>\\r\\n<p>To sum it up:<br />Soldier: 1 license, digital copy (Win/Mac/Linux/Xbox/PS4) OR physical copy (Win/Mac/Linux) <br />Knight: 1 license, digital copy (Win/Mac/Linux/Xbox/PS4) OR physical copy (Win/Mac/Linux) <br />Baron: Win/Mac/Linux/Xbox/PS4, 1 license, digital AND physical <br />Earl: Win/Mac/Linux/Xbox/PS4, 1 license, digital AND physical <br />Duke: Win/Mac/Linux/Xbox/PS4, 2 licenses, digital AND physical <br />… all higher tiers are like Duke in this respect</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>You described the game also as a sandbox but how much sandboxy is going to be? Can I buy castles or run an army for example? </strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>Many people wonder how much of a sandbox our sandbox is going to be. You will be able to solve quests in multiple ways, kill most of NPCs or influence their day/night cycles. We have a complex system of reputation, relationships and law. You can influence local economy to an extent (price of goods).</p>\\r\\n<p>The player’s character is going to have a place to stay and live, but you will not be able to buy and sell real estate. Nor you can control other characters. Companions/henchmen have their own AI and they are quest-specific. Your character will develop relationships with NPCs.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>9 sq km doesn't sound like a lot so what about the map size?</strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>Some people are concerned about our maps size and seem to think that 9 sq. km. is not enough. Please trust us that it is. Our map is bigger than the one in Read Dead Redemption. The population/point-of-interest density is going to be on par with RDR. We want the world to look natural.<br />Also please mind that both Act II and Act III will each come with their own map, although they will be a bit smaller the length of designed gameplay should be on par with Act I.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>What about multiplayer? Some of your systems could make for a cool multiplayre experience.</strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>There seems to be demand for multiplayer experience. Unfortunately, Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a singleplayer game only. We are thinking about cooperative multiplayer in some further future, but definitely not for Act I.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Do you plan to implement 3rd person view? </strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>We are sorry, but we do not plan to allow you to control your character in 3rd person view (TPV). You will be able to see your character e.g. in cutscenes, dialogues or in the inventory screen, you can also see your body and hands all the time. We believe that FPV allows for better immersion in the world; we also think that we can make the FPV combat work. Moreover the many of the systems, including combat, are designed with FPV in mind and wouldn't work in TPV without a major redesign.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Fri, Feb 7 2014 12:22 PM CET </em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Can I get a DRM-free version of the game? </strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>We get many questions about DRM and whether our game is going to be DRM free. Frankly, we have to admit we are not sure at this moment. We are planning to use Steam on open platforms, so the game will be using Steam default copy protection mechanics. Other options including GOG.com are being considered but can't be confirmed as of yet.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Fri, Feb 7 2014 12:22 PM CET </em>\\r\\n</p>\n  880  26	26	en	2014-03-08 00:38:40.301671	2014-03-28 12:39:58.407496	<h2>1.

We shall have a professional archaeologist/historian to guide you and explain everything and you will be able to get to places that are normally off limits. </p>\\r\\n<h2>Collectors items</h2>\\r\\n<p>Various collectors’ items are part of our special editions. We are making an authentic medieval game, though, and we are loath to give our fans usual cheap trinkets. Know then, that everything you are going to get, are unique, bespoke crafted items, far cry from plastic tchotchke.<br />It may have something to do with the fact that Dan studied at School of applied arts in Turnov among engravers, smiths and goldsmiths, he doesn’t settle for less and knows a lot of craftsmen that can help us.</p>\\r\\n<h3><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Swords</span>\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>Swords are perhaps the most attractive reward. Fantastic looking swords covered from grip to tip by Celtic knots, glass gems and entwined dragons are available almost anywhere for few bucks. Such a worthless trinket will of course break when a zombie apocalypse comes and you try to use it to decapitate an undead one.</p>\\r\\n<p>Our swords are real, made for fencing, with forged blades, you can take them to battle. Of course, these are replicas of real swords, no phantasmagoria from a kids movie. The blade will be decorated by etching or engraving and pommel with a pattern.</p>\\r\\n<ul><li><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Sword (Emperor): You will receive hand made, forged, one-handed sword. It will be sharpened and ready for battle. This is not a toy! 18+. Inscription. Check your country laws about import.</span>\\r\\n</li><li><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Deliverance Sword (Wenzel) – Deliverance motive&#160;</span>\\r\\n</li><li><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Sword (Pope) – Personal inscription</span>\\r\\n</li><li><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Sword (Iluminatus/Saint) – One and half handed, personal inscription</span>\\r\\n</li><li><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Shield: This will be hand-decorated shield adorned with coat-of-arms of a noble family related to the events within the game.</span>\\r\\n</li></ul>\\r\\n<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">As we are going to need really lot of swords, they are probably going to be produced in more workshops. At the bottom, you can watch the video where Dan visits some of them to see their manufacturing process. In this case it’s Dan’s former fellow student Ondřej Piskáček and one of the biggest armories in Europe – </span>\\r\\n<a title=\"http://www.kovex-ars.cz/\" href=\"http://www.kovex-ars.cz/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Kovex Ars</a>\\r\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">.</span>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>&#160;<img src=\"/system/images/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMDMvMjgvMTZfNTZfNTVfOTU1X21lY2VhemJyb2plLmpwZyJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiNDUweDQ1MD4iXSxbInAiLCJzdHJpcCJdXQ/meceazbroje.jpg\" title=\"Meceazbroje\" alt=\"Meceazbroje\" data-rel=\"450x450\" height=\"336\" width=\"450\" /></p>\\r\\n<h3>Action Figure</h3>\\r\\n<p>We briefly entertained a possibility of making plastic figures in China, but then we thought better of it.

Jindra suggested woodcut and you can get ready for an exceptional artistic work, numbered and signed on luxury, hand-made paper. The pictures show some of Jindra’s work and an original print of a fifteenth century woodblock.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMDMvMjgvMTZfNTZfNDRfNDAxX2VuZ3JhdmluZy5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjQ1MHg0NTA%2BIl0sWyJwIiwic3RyaXAiXV0/engraving.jpg\" title=\"Engraving\" alt=\"Engraving\" data-rel=\"450x450\" height=\"450\" width=\"425\" /></p>\\r\\n<h3>Coin</h3>\\r\\n<p>Our coin is not going to be a thin penny-press elongateds.

In Q4 2014 we will release an early build of the game, with one smaller location (village and a part of the countryside) where you will be able to test core mechanics of the game. We will start with the basic mechanics (interaction with the world, inventory, map, NPC cycles) and we will constantly update this build with new features as we progress with the development (dialogues, bows, hunting, crafting, combat, horses). This is the access to Alpha version of the game and it will be available to all tiers from the Baron onwards.</p>\\r\\n<p>When the game is in Beta stage, we will release the full game beta as Early Access on PC (or any other platform where it’s going to be possible) for all backers up from the Knight Tier.</p>\\r\\n<p>Our backers can influence the development, help us improve the game, and give us feedback about our game mechanics.</p>\n  885  \\.\n  ...\n  919  25	13	Side Body		1	2014-03-08 00:36:43.206611	2014-03-08 00:36:43.206611\n  920  27	14	Side Body		1	2014-03-08 00:38:40.304866	2014-03-08 00:38:40.304866\n  921: 24	13	Body	<p><strong>I don’t understand the concept of Acts. What is Act I, II and III? Why there is not cheaper tier offering all three Acts?</strong> </p>\\r\\n<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Act I, as it is planned, is a full scale, stand-alone game. It has 30+ hours of gameplay, complete open world map, all quests and closed story line. Most (if not all) game mechanics described above will be included: horse riding, combat, castle sieges, there will be at least one large-scale battle. Acts II &amp; III extend the story, add new environment in separate maps, new quests, gear and weapons. They will also add new quests to the map of Act I. It will be possible to travel between maps of all Acts, some quests will require you to visit all of them.</p>\\r\\n<p>We definitely intend to make Acts II &amp; III and release them as soon as possible. However, our funding and schedule does not reach past first Act. We will finalize our plans for the release of Acts II &amp; III when we get closer to the release date of Act I. For these reasons we don’t want to offer and promise them as a Kickstarter reward in their own right. We want to use them as a token of our gratitude to higher tiers backers, but you should think about it more like 100% discount offer than a guaranteed reward.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em> </p>\\r\\n<p><strong>What platforms are offered to backers on Kickstarter and what is minimum requirement of PC version ?</strong> </p>\\r\\n<p>We are developing the game to run smoothly on “good gaming PC” and next-gen consoles. If you have a PC, hardware-wise similar to Xbox One or PS4, you should be able to run Kingdom Come: Deliverance well.</p>\\r\\n<p>About platforms: we are using proven technology (Cryengine by CryTek) that runs on both PS4 and Xbox One, as well as on Windows PC, Mac and Linux. While we are developing on PC , we definitely want to bring the game to other platforms. While there should be nothing but technical problems with Linux and Mac, on closed platforms we need to deal with the platform holders and we cannot prejudge their decision. In an ideal world, we would release the game on all five platforms at the same time.</p>\\r\\n<p>In our world, we can offer you PC version in all tiers. From the “Baron” tier above, you will be able to choose our game on any platform you wish from those mentioned above (i.e. Windows PC / Mac / Linux / Xbox One / PS4), with the proviso that on consoles the game must be approved by the platform holders first. In case we are not able to finish or release the game on the platform you chose for any reason, you will be able to choose again (from available platforms) or demand your money back.</p>\\r\\n<p>UDPATE: Since we came to agreement with Microsoft we can now guarantee Xbox One version of the game also on lower tiers. The situation is still the same with PS4 though. Actual situation:</p>\\r\\n<p>Soldier, Knight: 1 license, digital copy (Win/Mac/Linux/Xone) OR physical copy (Win/Mac/Linux) <br />Baron, Viscount, Earl: 1 license, digital copy AND physical copy (Win/Mac/Linux/Xone/PS4) <br />Duke and all higher tiers: 2 licenses, 2 digital copies AND 1 physical copy (Win/Mac/Linux/Xone/PS4)</p>\\r\\n<p>UPDATE 2: We have now been approved by Sony for PS4 as well. We are now happy to offer the digital version for all platforms and for all tiers. With boxed version on console platforms, we are not sure, but the worst-case scenario is that you will get all physical rewards (including box, etc.) for your tier and a digital license.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Feb 19 2014 12:12 PM CET</em> </p>\\r\\n<p><strong>But how can I choose a specific platform while pledging? </strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>You don’t need to! Just choose a pledge that suits you. Your pledge will be filed and if it’s of Baron tier or higher you will be asked to choose a platform once the release date draws nigh. You can change this any time later – we will inform you how to do that via an e-mail.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>What are the differences between PC and console versions of the game? </strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>We develop both version together so neither is a port of the other. Technically speaking, console version will be very similar to a PC one; it’s probable that on a high-end PC you can get better and smoother visual effects but artistic feeling should be very close.</p>\\r\\n<p>Controls-wise, the game is designed separately for console controller and for keyboard &amp; mouse gaming. Of course, you can still use your favorite game controller on PC or on SteamBox. But if you decide to use mouse and keyboard, you will control the game just like other first-person games on the market: you will be able to use your mouse in the UI, there will be no controller hints and controls will be fully customizable. Some control elements may be slightly different on keyboard &amp; mouse than they are on a gamepad but neither control method will be generally superior to the other.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Can I download the game even if I buy the physical reward tier? </strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>On Soldier and Knight you have to choose between digital and physical copy of the game. We anticipate that there will be some costs associated with digital distribution (and we know there are going to be costs with the physical copies) and for this reason we have created an option to choose one or the other and we cannot fulfill both. From Baron (special edition) tier upwards you will get both physical and digital version of the game.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Do you plan to support Oculus Rift? </strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>Cryengine supports Oculus Rift by default, so general answer is: yes. We plan to support this awesome hardware gadget.<br />Oculus Rift captured the imagination of many players and you ask about it very often. Cryengine supports Oculus Rift by default, however we realize that the game has to be developed with Oculus in mind and we are aware of their recommended Best Practices. We shall try to stick to these recommendations, but VR is still an uncharted territory and we can’t guarantee ideal results from get go. To create horse riding experience that won’t give you motion sickness looks like a real challenge.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>What language versions do you plan? </strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>We’re creating the game in English and with English voiceovers. We would like to make French, Italian, German and Spanish versions of the game as well. Our past experience also suggests there will be a Polish, Russian and Czech version of the game, not necessarily with voiceovers, though.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>What type of sword do I get on the highest tiers? </strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>It is a medieval European 15th century type of one-handed sword (for Emperor, Wenzel der Faule and Pope tiers) or hand-and-a-half sword, also called bastard sword (Illuminatus and Saint tiers). It is a real-sized hand-forged weapon created by a local blacksmith, not a serial production. It can be used for combat or combat training, you can choose whether it's sharpened or not. We will communicate with you via e-mail once the campaign ends regarding the details.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>If I get physical as well as digital copy of the game, how many licenses do I get? </strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>This depends on your Tier (and we apologize it is not clearer in the tier description):<br />On Baron and Earl tier you only receive one license (i.e. you can play either one, but you cannot for example sell the box and keep the digital copy). Obviously, both physical and digital license have to be on the same platform.</p>\\r\\n<p>From Duke tier upwards you receive additional digital copy, meaning extra digital license. The physical and 'first' digital copy again have to be for the same platform, but the extra license can be for a different one.</p>\\r\\n<p>To sum it up:<br />Soldier: 1 license, digital copy (Win/Mac/Linux/Xbox/PS4) OR physical copy (Win/Mac/Linux) <br />Knight: 1 license, digital copy (Win/Mac/Linux/Xbox/PS4) OR physical copy (Win/Mac/Linux) <br />Baron: Win/Mac/Linux/Xbox/PS4, 1 license, digital AND physical <br />Earl: Win/Mac/Linux/Xbox/PS4, 1 license, digital AND physical <br />Duke: Win/Mac/Linux/Xbox/PS4, 2 licenses, digital AND physical <br />… all higher tiers are like Duke in this respect</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>You described the game also as a sandbox but how much sandboxy is going to be? Can I buy castles or run an army for example? </strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>Many people wonder how much of a sandbox our sandbox is going to be. You will be able to solve quests in multiple ways, kill most of NPCs or influence their day/night cycles. We have a complex system of reputation, relationships and law. You can influence local economy to an extent (price of goods).</p>\\r\\n<p>The player’s character is going to have a place to stay and live, but you will not be able to buy and sell real estate. Nor you can control other characters. Companions/henchmen have their own AI and they are quest-specific. Your character will develop relationships with NPCs.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>9 sq km doesn't sound like a lot so what about the map size?</strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>Some people are concerned about our maps size and seem to think that 9 sq. km. is not enough. Please trust us that it is. Our map is bigger than the one in Read Dead Redemption. The population/point-of-interest density is going to be on par with RDR. We want the world to look natural.<br />Also please mind that both Act II and Act III will each come with their own map, although they will be a bit smaller the length of designed gameplay should be on par with Act I.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>What about multiplayer? Some of your systems could make for a cool multiplayre experience.</strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>There seems to be demand for multiplayer experience. Unfortunately, Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a singleplayer game only. We are thinking about cooperative multiplayer in some further future, but definitely not for Act I.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Wed, Jan 22 2014 2:25 PM CET</em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Do you plan to implement 3rd person view? </strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>We are sorry, but we do not plan to allow you to control your character in 3rd person view (TPV). You will be able to see your character e.g. in cutscenes, dialogues or in the inventory screen, you can also see your body and hands all the time. We believe that FPV allows for better immersion in the world; we also think that we can make the FPV combat work. Moreover the many of the systems, including combat, are designed with FPV in mind and wouldn't work in TPV without a major redesign.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Fri, Feb 7 2014 12:22 PM CET </em>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Can I get a DRM-free version of the game? </strong>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>We get many questions about DRM and whether our game is going to be DRM free. Frankly, we have to admit we are not sure at this moment. We are planning to use Steam on open platforms, so the game will be using Steam default copy protection mechanics. Other options including GOG.com are being considered but can't be confirmed as of yet.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Last updated: Fri, Feb 7 2014 12:22 PM CET </em>\\r\\n</p>	0	2014-03-08 00:36:42.962435	2014-03-28 12:35:54.965523\n  922  26	14	Body	<h2>1.

The final form, state and features of the Project and the Reward are strictly subject to the Company’s discretion. The Donor shall not have any rights in that respect and no claim of the Donor shall arise from the final form, state and features of the Project and the Reward.</p>\\r\\n<p>6.4. Unless expressly stated otherwise, nothing in the Contract and / or these TaC shall have any impact on the intellectual property rights of the Company, including (but not limited to) any such rights with respect to any software, software updates or patches, or other utilities and tools or any other technology, text and audio visual material, the design and appearance of the Website, the Project and / or the Reward.</p>\\r\\n<p>6.5.

One of our best engravers, Dan’s buddy and former classmate, Martin Reichard, who creates gold and silver designs for the best mints, will create a top notch collectible 30x2mm coin with a game motif.

We shall have a professional archaeologist/historian to guide you and explain everything and you will be able to get to places that are normally off limits. </p>\\r\\n<h2>Collectors items</h2>\\r\\n<p>Various collectors’ items are part of our special editions. We are making an authentic medieval game, though, and we are loath to give our fans usual cheap trinkets. Know then, that everything you are going to get, are unique, bespoke crafted items, far cry from plastic tchotchke.<br />It may have something to do with the fact that Dan studied at School of applied arts in Turnov among engravers, smiths and goldsmiths, he doesn’t settle for less and knows a lot of craftsmen that can help us.</p>\\r\\n<h3><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Swords</span>\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>Swords are perhaps the most attractive reward. Fantastic looking swords covered from grip to tip by Celtic knots, glass gems and entwined dragons are available almost anywhere for few bucks. Such a worthless trinket will of course break when a zombie apocalypse comes and you try to use it to decapitate an undead one.</p>\\r\\n<p>Our swords are real, made for fencing, with forged blades, you can take them to battle. Of course, these are replicas of real swords, no phantasmagoria from a kids movie. The blade will be decorated by etching or engraving and pommel with a pattern.</p>\\r\\n<ul><li><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Sword (Emperor): You will receive hand made, forged, one-handed sword.
